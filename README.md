## 👤 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer currently focused on building **global identity verification system**, combining **mobile NFC technology**, **cryptography**, and **fullstack development**. My work spans from chip communication to scalable backend APIs and web interfaces.

## 🧠 Technical Focus

- **.NET MAUI (Android-first)**  
  NFC-based ePassport reading with support for PACE, DG1, DG2 parsing, and secure session handshakes.

- **ASP.NET Core**  
  RESTful APIs for identity binding, QR-based session flows, and personal data verification using SSN and MRZ data.

- **Razor MVC**  
  Responsive frontends that reflect real-time verification status via secure polling, session tracking, and dynamic feedback.

- **Cryptographic Tooling**  
  Hands-on with `BouncyCastle`, secure messaging, APDU command building, and byte-level passport interaction.
